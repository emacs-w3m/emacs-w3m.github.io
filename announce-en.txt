	Compromise of karin.namazu.org server

We are very sad to inform you that karin.namazu.org, which provided
web, ftp, mailing lists, and CVS was cracked at 2004/05/23 02:00 JST,
and was forced to shut down at 2004/05/25 02:49 JST.

Fortunately, the file "emacs-w3m-1.4.tar.gz" and older tarballs which
had been already released were not affected by this incident, and
users can continuously use them without any problems.

The project members are in the process of reconstructing all of the
services, and we kindly ask for your patience until everything is
restored.

Further information will be provided at http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/.
